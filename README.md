This is a mobile app for hitchhiking between Innopolis and Kazan. In the app, there are two main types of users (other than admin); driver and passenger. A driver can publish his upcoming trip with the exact route and details about the trip such as departure time, number availabe seats, etc. A user can search for trips either From Kazan To Innopolis or From Innopolis To Kazan, and register on the trip. 

There will also be many functionalites avaialbe for both driver and passenger such as canceling the ride, canceling the trip, contacting driver/passenger, etc.

## What problem are we solving?

Most of Innopolis residents and workers suffer from the lack of public transportation between Kazan and Innopolis. Therefore, most of "Innopolisians" try to find a ride with someone driving from Kazan to Innopolis or vice versa. People try to solve this problem using a Telegram chat [Попутчики Иннополис](https://t.me/joinchat/BZaU2UDW8zpUizpiMvDRQA) with around 3000 users.

Our goal to implement a software which basically implements a solution for this problem with many functionalites that make it easy and convinient for people to use.

## Prototype

The prototype of our mobile app can be found in folder `prototype`.
